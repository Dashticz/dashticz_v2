# Frequently Asked Questions

###How to use this dashboard if Domoticz is password protected?
Open up CONFIG.js in a text-editor (notepad for example).
Fill in the full path for Domoticz, e.g.: http://username:password@192.168.1.3:8084 (withouth trailing slash)

###When Domoticz is updated, it has removed this dashboard?!
Unfortunately, this occurs when the dashboard is installed into Domoticz's www-directory.
When Domoticz installs an update, it removes the www-directory completely, before placing the updated version back. 
You'll have to re-install Dashticz in that case.

####There are a few solutions to this:
- Install dashticz on another web server
- Make a symlink in the `www` folder in Domoticz: 
  - Install or copy Dashticz to a folder outside the Domoticz folder, i.e. `/home/pi/dashticz_v2/`
  - Make a symlink: `ln -s /home/pi/dashticz_v2/ /home/pi/domoticz/www/dashticz`
  - Now you can access Dashticz on `http://domoticz_ip:port/dashticz/index.html`
  - After a Domoticz update, you only need to make the symlink again.
