# Frequently Asked Questions

<b>How to use this dashboard if Domoticz is password protected?</b><br />
Open up CONFIG.js in a text-editor (notepad for example).
Fill in the full path for Domoticz, e.g.: http://username:password@192.168.1.3:8084 (withouth trailing slash)

<b>When Domoticz is updated, it has removed this dashboard?!</b><br />
Unfortunately, this occurs when the dashboard is installed into Domoticz's www-directory.
When Domoticz installs an update, it removes the www-directory completely, before placing the updated version back. Currently, there is no solution for this (except for installing the dashboard on another webserver), you'll have to re-install Dashticz.

<b>Where can I get any help?</b><br />
