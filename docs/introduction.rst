Why Dashticz
------------

The Dashboard of Domoticz is quite powerful. The disadvantage is that it's only possible to show information known in Domoticz.
There is where Dashticz steps in. Dashticz is able to show (almost) all Domoticz information.
In addition to that it's possible to show information from all kind of other sources.

Concept
-------

The Dashticz dashboard may consist of several screens.

Every screen consist of one or more columns.

In every column you place one or more blocks.

A block may be a Domoticz device, external content being displayed in a frame, or some special block.

The next section provides an overview on how to configure Dashticz the system,
how to configure a block, how to add blocks to a column,
and how to define screens.
