Columns
=======

The various examples in the documentation show how to add blocks to columns,
and how to add columns to screens.

Besides the column-width there are no additional column parameters or settings.

One thing to mention is that's possible to reuse a column on more than one screen.
This can be useful if for instance you want to have the same first column for all screens.
